description: Build a single feature as a full sprint with approval gates, verification, and documentation updates. Use when the user describes a feature to build and wants structured delivery with PLAN.md tracking, ARCHITECTURE.md updates, and decision logging.

# Feature Sprint

## Purpose

Use this skill when the user asks you to build a single feature. Each feature is treated as one complete sprint with approval gates and verification before completion.

## Required Behavior

- Treat the **entire feature as one sprint**. Do not split it into mini-sprints unless the user asks or it is clearly necessary — ask first.
- A feature **stays active** from invocation until the user explicitly confirms completion at the completion gate. Any tweaks or follow-up requests before that confirmation are iterations on the same feature and must be included in the final documentation.
- Build only what was requested. Do not add unrequested features.
- If something breaks, fix it before continuing.
- Keep explanations concise unless the user asks for detail.
- Support pause/resume across sessions using `PLAN.md`.

## Default Build Order

Implement in this order when relevant:

1. `packages/shared` — types and state contract changes
2. `apps/server` — handlers or API behavior
3. `apps/web` — UI and client behavior

## First Feature (App Bootstrap)

If `PLAN.md` does not exist, this is the first feature. The user's request **must** include what the overall app is (e.g. "we are building a task management app"). If they didn't provide this, ask: _"What app are we building?"_ before proceeding. The app goal is recorded in `PLAN.md` under **App Goal** and never removed.

## Session Start

1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` if it exists.
2. Read `PLAN.md` if it exists.
3. Read `DECISIONS.md` if it exists.
4. **Concurrency check**: if `PLAN.md` has any active sprints with `in_progress` status, check whether their scopes overlap with this feature's scope. If scopes overlap, warn: _"Active sprint [name] is working in [scope]. This feature also touches that area — proceeding may cause file conflicts."_ Let the user decide whether to continue. Non-overlapping sprints are fine.
5. Restate the feature in one sentence.
6. Propose a plan and wait for approval before coding.

## Persistent Plan File (`PLAN.md`)

Maintain a root-level `PLAN.md` as the source of truth for the current feature.

### When to create/update

1. Create `PLAN.md` if it does not exist.
2. Write or refresh the plan before coding starts.
3. Update immediately after verification and on scope changes.
4. On session end, leave clear next steps so another agent can continue.

### Required structure

```md
# Plan

## App Goal
<what we are building — set once on first feature, never removed>

## Context
- Last updated: <date/time>

## Completed Features
- [x] Feature A
- [x] Feature B

## Active Sprints

### <Feature Name>
- Status: planned | in_progress | blocked | completed
- Scope: <directories this feature touches, e.g. apps/web, packages/shared>
- Plan: <1-3 bullets>
- Verification: <tests/screenshots/manual checks>
- Notes: <important decisions, blockers, scope changes>
- Next step: <single clear next action for this sprint>
```

Each active sprint gets its own subsection under **Active Sprints**. When a feature completes, move it to **Completed Features** and remove its subsection.

## Mandatory Approval Gates

Do not proceed past any gate until the user confirms.

1. **Plan gate**: share a 1-2 sentence plan for the full feature, write/update `PLAN.md`, and ask for approval.
2. **Sprint gate**: implement the feature, then stop and report exactly what changed.
3. **Verification gate**: run browser-based visual verification when available and provide evidence (screenshot when possible). If browser tooling is unavailable, run available checks and request manual visual verification.
4. **Completion gate**: ask the user to confirm the feature is done before running the completion steps below.

## Feature Completion (mandatory)

After the user confirms a feature is complete:

1. **Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** to reflect the current state of the system. Add or revise sections for any new components, data flows, API endpoints, or patterns introduced by this feature. `ARCHITECTURE.md` must always describe the system as it exists *now*.
2. **Append to `DECISIONS.md`** with a summary of the feature and key decisions. Use this format:

```md
## <Feature Name> — <date>

**What**: <1-2 sentence summary of what was built>

**Key decisions**:
- <decision 1 and reasoning>
- <decision 2 and reasoning>

**Trade-offs / alternatives considered**:
- <anything rejected and why>
```

3. **Update `PLAN.md`** — move the feature to the completed list, remove its subsection from Active Sprints, and update the next step.

## Per-Sprint Response Format

After the sprint, respond in this structure:

1. `Intent`: feature targeted (1 sentence)
2. `Changes`: key files and behaviors updated
3. `Verification`: visual/test result and any evidence
4. `Status`: done, partial, or blocked
5. `Plan Update`: what was changed in `PLAN.md`
6. `Question`: explicit approval request before proceeding

## Constraints

- Keep existing dark theme and design tokens.
- Keep top navigation layout unless user asks otherwise.
- Use Zustand for client state.
- Follow existing API client patterns for new features.
- Avoid broad refactors unless required to unblock the feature.
